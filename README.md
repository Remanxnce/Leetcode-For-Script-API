# Leetcode for Script API

Wanting to learn the script API? wanting to just learn how to code? 
Hopefully, with Minecraft Bedrock's scripting API and the challenges 
I've made, you'll be able to gain a decent idea of how to code using 
the Script API.

## About

A lot of people recently have been asking me to help them learn how to code. While I don't mind helping people, I didn't want to do one-on-one teaching to people that I hardly knew.
So, my solution? create this. leetcode exists for people who want to learn how to code better, and while that applies to general code, some people lack the motivation or initial skils to learn code. My hope is that by making this, I'll be able to push people in the right direction with coding.
